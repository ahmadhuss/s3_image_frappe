I take security issues seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by opening an issue on GitHub (if appropriate) or by contacting me directly at **ahmadhussnain787@gmail.com**.

I will review all reports promptly and work towards resolving them as quickly as possible.
